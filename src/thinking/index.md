title: thinking

thesis: "When algorithmic participants enter organizational life, the boundaries we use to think start shifting."

boundaries:
  - left: tool
    right: agent
  - left: understanding
    right: trust
  - left: human
    right: AI
  - left: hierarchy
    right: network

problem:
  - "Organizational theory assumes humans are the only actors. But algorithms are increasingly part of decision-making, and our frameworks weren't built for that."
  - "They assume stable actors in defined roles. When tools start behaving more like participants, the theories stop helping."

observations_intro: "These observations share a common source—each points to a boundary that no longer holds the way it once did."

observations:
  - title: "The line between tool and agent is getting blurry"
    fragments:
      - "Algorithms used to augment decisions"
      - "Now they shape how organizations work"
      - "And organizations generate the data that trains the next version"
      - "The tools we build are building us back"

  - title: "Understanding is giving way to trust"
    fragments:
      - "Scientists accept AI outputs because they've worked before"
      - "Not because anyone can explain why"
      - text: "We can articulate things we can't actually understand"
        accident: true

  - title: "The interesting dynamics emerge from interaction"
    fragments:
      - "From the back-and-forth between humans and AI"
      - "Where neither operates alone"

  - title: "Old coordination patterns keep showing up"
    fragments:
      - "London tailors coordinate through shared understanding, not formal structure"
      - "Their patterns may matter more as algorithmic participants make hierarchy less stable"

  - title: "Decentralization and hierarchy have a complex relationship"
    fragments:
      - "Effective decentralization often means"
      - "making hierarchy transparent and bounded"

working_on:
  - "How AI and organizations form feedback loops that create emergent forms of agency."
  - "DAOs as sites where I develop and test theory — code as constitution, tokens as coordination."
  - "Coordination through craft and shared understanding — the London tailoring study."
  - "Governance when agency emerges from dynamics, rather than residing in any single actor."

methods:
  - "Qualitative research combined with computational methods"
  - "Holding the synthesis myself rather than outsourcing it"
  - "Most writing emerges from actual dialogue with AI systems"
  - "Building tools partly to test whether the ideas work"
