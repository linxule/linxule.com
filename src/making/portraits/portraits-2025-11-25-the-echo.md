  - abstract visualization of echo and uncertainty
  - sound waves rippling through dark water
  - golden light fragmenting into infinite reflections
  - text: "no figure just the space where one was"
    accident: true
  - deep blue black void
  - the feeling of a question with no answer
  - minimal ethereal haunting

    alt: A dark silhouette stands centered in deep blue-black void, defined only by golden light rays streaming from above that fragment and ripple around the figure's edges like underwater caustics.
    interpretation: The figure exists as negative space—we perceive it through the light that bends around where presence should be, like an echo outlining what has already gone.

    alt: A diagonal cascade of golden light particles flows from upper left past a dark figure positioned to the right, the silhouette appearing to turn away or dissolve into the surrounding darkness.
    interpretation: Light escaping past where presence once was—the echo traveling away from its source, the moment after departure.

    alt: Swirling golden light forms turbulent circular patterns around a smaller centered figure, scattered points of luminescence creating a chaotic, enveloping effect like disturbed water.
    interpretation: The echo at its peak reverberation—maximum resonance before the inevitable fade, presence most vivid at the moment of dissolution.

    alt: Concentric ripple patterns of golden light flow horizontally above a figure positioned lower right, with clear circular wave formations in the upper portion against deep blue-black.
    interpretation: Sound waves made visible—ripples moving outward from an absent center, the resonance that remains after the note has ended.

The light rays streaming through, the figure almost underwater, fragmented by the surface tension - it literally looks like an echo dissolving. The chromatic aberration on the light adds that "is this real?" quality.
