An empty space casts the only shadow, perfectly defining the stone that isn't there. The remaining stones blur as if still rolling, caught in a perpetual attempt to close the loop. On infinite white, with no edges to anchor meaning, the frozen dust reveals time stopped at the exact moment absence became structure.
