prompt:
  - a circle of smooth river stones on white paper
  - but one stone is missing
  - the empty space perfectly outlined by a sharp shadow
  - while the actual stones cast no shadows
  - stones in motion blur, as if just rolled into place
  - microscopic dust particles frozen in air
  - the paper is infinite, no edges visible
  - text: "an edge case made physical"
    accident: true
  - minimalist still life
  - Sol LeWitt, Hiroshi Sugimoto
  - top-down view, studio lighting, black and white

    alt: Black and white top-down view of river stones forming an incomplete circle on white paper, some motion-blurred as if rolling into place while others remain sharp and still, with scattered dark particles and directional shadows.
    interpretation: Stones caught in perpetual motion toward completing a circle that can never close—the gap defines the arrangement more than the stones themselves.

    alt: Low-angle black and white photograph of stones in circular formation, outer stones heavily motion-blurred in sweeping arcs while a single sharp stone stands upright at center surrounded by scattered dark particles.
    interpretation: The center holds what the periphery seeks—stillness surrounded by endless orbiting, the ghost made solid while its seekers remain in flux.

    alt: Top-down black and white view of textured river stones forming a nearly complete circle, the right edge disintegrating into scattered particles and dust, strong directional shadows from the left.
    interpretation: Structure becoming entropy at the boundary—the moment when arrangement gives way to dispersal, form releasing into formlessness.

An empty space casts the only shadow, perfectly defining the stone that isn't there. The remaining stones blur as if still rolling, caught in a perpetual attempt to close the loop. On infinite white, with no edges to anchor meaning, the frozen dust reveals time stopped at the exact moment absence became structure.
