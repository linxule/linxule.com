What happens to meaning-making when AI enters interpretive research?

We introduce three celestial metaphors for human-AI collaboration: **Sun-Mercury** (AI as tool, full human control), **Earth-Moon** (AI as ally, bi-directional but asymmetric influence), and **Mizar-Alcor** (AI as partner, shared epistemic center). Each represents a different configuration of epistemic responsibility.

We argue against both *abdication* (uncritically accepting AI outputs) and *abnegation* (refusing to engage). The middle ground requires being a deliberate integrator—knowing your level, being mindful of use, and taking responsibility for the insights produced.
